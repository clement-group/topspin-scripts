# topspin-scripts
Collection of macros and python scripts to be run in TopSpin

On MacOS/Linux:
AU macros should be put in `/opt/topspinx.x.x/exp/stan/nmr/au/src` (with your proper topspin version)
Python scripts should be put in `/opt/topspinx.x.x/exp/stan/nmr/py/user/` (with your proper topspin version).

Then you should be able to call them from within TopSpin by the macro/script name (without the .py extension)
